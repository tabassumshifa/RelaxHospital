**My Contribution:

This project was developed as part of a team.  
I was responsible for designing and implementing the Doctor Module, which includes:

- Doctor registration and login
- Viewing and editing doctor profiles
- Managing doctor-patient assignments
- Database integration using ADO.NET (SQL Server)

This module demonstrates my skills in C# (Windows Forms), database handling, and user interface design.
